## goingplaces

**goingplaces** is an app that lets users post travel tips about the
places they've visited! All a user has to do to make a new post is
sign up, and then the user will be routed to the home page to view a
list of current cities.

Users can add, edit, and delete posts on the city of their choosing and
they can also see all of their posts on their profile page.

One challenge for this project were implementing ruby on rails with its ready-made routes and classes and instance variables. Ruby is so easy, it's hard. The other challenge for this project was working as a team. But we handled this challenge well, using specific github and workflow protocols and by keeping good communication.
