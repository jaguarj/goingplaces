## goingplaces

**goingplaces** is an app that lets users post travel tips about the
places they've visited! All a user has to do to make a new post is
just sign up, and then the user will be routed to the home page to view a
list of current cities.

Users can add, edit, and delete posts on the city of their choosing and
they can also see all of their posts on their profile page.
